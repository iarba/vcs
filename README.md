### Virtual Control System

This software is meant to be used as an API for interacting with a computer exclusively through software, even when the software wouldn't generally allow it. Example usage is automation of GUI-only proprietary applications by emulating user input through the operating system, effectively becoming a software-controlled virtual mouse/keyboard.
